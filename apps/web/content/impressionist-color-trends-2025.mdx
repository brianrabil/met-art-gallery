Impressionism’s sun-soaked hues are trending again, but this time they’re pairing with smart-lighting presets, sustainable fabrics, and AI-matched wall art. Here are the five palettes shaking up showrooms.

## 1. Mist-Blue Monets

Inspired by the hero painting “La Grenouillère” (1869), this palette features Lake-Blue (#6A9DE0), Reed-Green (#8AA783), and Cloud-Gray (#D4D9DF). It works especially well to cool down south-facing rooms without feeling icy, and pairs beautifully with off-white boucle sofas.

## 2. Renoir Rosewood

Drawing from “Two Young Girls at the Piano” (1892), the Renoir Rosewood palette includes Rosewood (#B37877), Lace-Cream (#F6EFE8), and Walnut-Brown (#7D5B4A). This combination adds warmth to minimalist interiors—imagine rosewood credenzas set against micro-cement floors.

## 3. Pissarro Pewter

Inspired by “Boulevard Montmartre, Winter Morning” (1897), this palette brings together Pewter-Gray (#8F9297), Fog-White (#E9ECF0), and Taxi-Yellow (#E8BF60). It gives industrial lofts a fresh update with a soft, metropolitan mist.

## 4. Degas Ballet Blush

Taking cues from “The Dancing Class” (1874), Degas Ballet Blush features Ballet-Blush (#EBCCD4), Tutu-Ivory (#F5F1EE), and Stage-Shadow (#524C46). The result is a feminine look that isn’t saccharine, and it pops next to aged brass fixtures.

## 5. Sisley Skyfade

Based on “The Bridge at Villeneuve-la-Garenne” (1872), the Sisley Skyfade palette includes Skyfade-Blue (#A3C1DE), River-Steel (#6A7F99), and Marsh-Olive (#8D906E). This combination evokes outdoor serenity, making it ideal for spa bathrooms and meditation corners.
