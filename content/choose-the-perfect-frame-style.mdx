A frame does more than protect paper—it finishes the narrative an artwork begins. Below are six timeless profiles, complete with pro tips and ideal room pairings. Test each instantly in **PaletteMatch AR** to see which one completes your space.

---

## 1. Thin Maple Float

Light, Scandinavian, and barely-there—perfect for airy interiors and pastel color schemes.
**Try it with:** Monet’s water-lily series or Morisot’s delicate portraits.

---

## 2. Satin-Black Box

Creates a crisp boundary that makes high-chroma Impressionist hues pop against white walls.
**Try it with:** Renoir’s *By the Seashore* for a gallery-style contrast.

---

## 3. Antique Gold Leaf

The go-to for classical dramas like Sargent or Degas; pairs beautifully with rich jewel-tone paint and moody lighting.

---

## 4. Brushed Aluminum

Industrial edge that echoes loft hardware and concrete backdrops while staying neutral.
**Try it with:** Pissarro’s winter cityscapes for understated sophistication.

---

## 5. White Gallery Wrap

Disappears into white walls, letting bold compositions—think Van Gogh or Gauguin—steal every glance. Ideal for minimalist studios.

---

## 6. Walnut Scoop

Warm, mid-century appeal—perfect alongside teak furniture or terracotta textiles.
**Try it with:** Sisley’s river vistas to amplify organic tones.
